        <h1>Asynchronous programming patterns - Task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP) - Overview</h1>
        <h2><a href="#in-this-article" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="in-this-article"></a>In this article</h2>
<p>In .NET, The task-based asynchronous pattern is the recommended asynchronous design pattern for new development. It is based on the Task and Task<TResult> types in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace, which are used to represent asynchronous operations.</p>
<h2><a href="#naming-parameters,-and-return-types" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="naming-parameters,-and-return-types"></a>Naming, parameters, and return types</h2>
<p>TAP uses a single method to represent the initiation and completion of an asynchronous operation. This contrasts with both the Asynchronous Programming Model (APM or <code>IAsyncResult</code>) pattern and the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP). APM requires <code>Begin</code> and <code>End</code> methods. EAP requires a method that has the <code>Async</code> suffix and also requires one or more events, event handler delegate types, and <code>EventArg</code>-derived types. Asynchronous methods in TAP include the <code>Async</code> suffix after the operation name for methods that return awaitable types, such as <code>Task</code>, <code>Task&lt;TResult&gt;</code>, <code>ValueTask</code>, and <code>ValueTask&lt;TResult&gt;</code>. For example, an asynchronous <code>Get</code> operation that returns a <code>Task&lt;String&gt;</code> can be named <code>GetAsync</code>. If you're adding a TAP method to a class that already contains an EAP method name with the <code>Async</code> suffix, use the suffix <code>TaskAsync</code> instead. For example, if the class already has a <code>GetAsync</code> method, use the name <code>GetTaskAsync</code>. If a method starts an asynchronous operation but does not return an awaitable type, its name should start with <code>Begin</code>, <code>Start</code>, or some other verb to suggest that this method does not return or throw the result of the operation.</p>
<p>A TAP method returns either a System.Threading.Tasks.Task or a <code>System.Threading.Tasks.Task&lt;TResult&gt;</code>, based on whether the corresponding synchronous method returns void or a type <code>TResult</code>.</p>
<p>The parameters of a TAP method should match the parameters of its synchronous counterpart and should be provided in the same order.  However, <code>out</code> and <code>ref</code> parameters are exempt from this rule and should be avoided entirely. Any data that would have been returned through an <code>out</code> or <code>ref</code> parameter should instead be returned as part of the <code>TResult</code> returned by <code>Task&lt;TResult&gt;</code>, and should use a tuple or a custom data structure to accommodate multiple values. Also, consider adding a CancellationToken parameter even if the TAP method's synchronous counterpart does not offer one.</p>
<p>Methods that are devoted exclusively to the creation, manipulation, or combination of tasks (where the asynchronous intent of the method is clear in the method name or in the name of the type to which the method belongs) need not follow this naming pattern; such methods are often referred to as combinators. Examples of combinators include WhenAll and WhenAny, and are discussed in the Using the Built-in Task-based Combinators section of the article Consuming the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern.</p>
<p>For examples of how the TAP syntax differs from the syntax used in legacy asynchronous programming patterns such as the Asynchronous Programming Model (APM) and the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP), see Asynchronous Programming Patterns.</p>
<h2><a href="#initiating-an-asynchronous-operation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="initiating-an-asynchronous-operation"></a>Initiating an asynchronous operation</h2>
<p>An asynchronous method that is based on TAP can do a small amount of work synchronously, such as validating arguments and initiating the asynchronous operation, before it returns the resulting task.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous methods may be invoked from user interface (UI) threads, and any long-running synchronous work could harm the responsiveness of the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple asynchronous methods may be launched concurrently. Therefore, any long-running work in the synchronous portion of an asynchronous method could delay the initiation of other asynchronous operations, thereby decreasing the benefits of concurrency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A read operation can be launched asynchronously or synchronously.</p>
<h2><a href="#exceptions" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="exceptions"></a>Exceptions</h2>
<p>An asynchronous method should raise an exception to be thrown <code>out</code> of the asynchronous method call only in response to a usage error. Usage errors should never occur in production code. For example, if passing a <code>null</code> reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) as one of the method's arguments causes an error state (usually represented by an ArgumentNullException exception), you can modify the calling code to ensure that a <code>null</code> reference is never passed. For all other errors, exceptions that occur when an asynchronous method is running should be assigned to the returned task, even if the asynchronous method happens to complete synchronously before the task is returned. Typically, a task contains at most one exception. However, if the task represents multiple operations (for example, WhenAll), multiple exceptions may be associated with a single task.</p>
<h2><a href="#target-environment" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="target-environment"></a>Target environment</h2>
<p>When you implement a TAP method, you can determine where asynchronous execution occurs. You may choose to execute the workload on the thread pool, implement it by using asynchronous I/O (without being bound to a thread for the majority of the operation's execution), run it on a specific thread (such as the UI thread), or use any number of potential contexts. A TAP method may even have nothing to execute, and may just return a Task that represents the occurrence of a condition elsewhere in the system (for example, a task that represents data arriving at a queued data structure).</p>
<p>The caller of the TAP method may block waiting for the TAP method to complete by synchronously waiting on the resulting task, or may run additional (continuation) code when the asynchronous operation completes. The creator of the continuation code has control over where that code executes. You may create the continuation code either explicitly, through methods on the Task class (for example, ContinueWith) or implicitly, by using language support built on top of continuations (for example, <code>await</code> in C#, <code>Await</code> in Visual Basic, <code>AwaitValue</code> in F#).</p>
<h2><a href="#task-status" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="task-status"></a>Task status</h2>
<p>The Task class provides a life cycle for asynchronous operations, and that cycle is represented by the TaskStatus enumeration. To support corner cases of types that derive from Task and Task<TResult>,  and to support the separation of construction from scheduling, the Task class exposes a <code>Start</code> method. Tasks that are created by the public Task constructors are referred to as cold tasks, because they begin their life cycle in the non-scheduled Created state and are scheduled only when <code>Start</code> is called on these instances.</p>
<p>All other tasks begin their life cycle in a hot state, which means that the asynchronous operations they represent have already been initiated and their task status is an enumeration value other than TaskStatus.Created. All tasks that are returned from TAP methods must be activated. If a TAP method internally uses a task's constructor to instantiate the task to be returned, the TAP method must call <code>Start</code> on the Task object before returning it. Consumers of a TAP method may safely assume that the returned task is active and should not try to call <code>Start</code> on any Task that is returned from a TAP method. Calling <code>Start</code> on an active task results in an InvalidOperationException exception.</p>
<h2><a href="#cancellation-optional)" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="cancellation-optional)"></a>Cancellation (optional)</h2>
<p>In TAP, cancellation is optional for both asynchronous method implementers and asynchronous method consumers. If an operation allows cancellation, it exposes an overload of the asynchronous method that accepts a cancellation token (CancellationToken instance). By convention, the parameter is named <code>cancellationToken</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task ReadAsync(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count,
                      CancellationToken cancellationToken)
</code></pre>
<p>The asynchronous operation monitors this token for cancellation requests. If it receives a cancellation request, it may choose to honor that request and cancel the operation. If the cancellation request results in work being ended prematurely, the TAP method returns a task that ends in the Canceled state; there is no available result and no exception is thrown.  The Canceled state is considered to be a final (completed) state for a task, along with the Faulted and RanToCompletion states. Therefore, if a task is in the Canceled state, its IsCompleted property returns <code>true</code>. When a task completes in the Canceled state, any continuations registered with the task are scheduled or executed, unless a continuation option such as NotOnCanceled was specified to opt <code>out</code> of continuation. Any code that is asynchronously waiting for a canceled task through use of language features continues to run but receives an OperationCanceledException or an exception derived from it. Code that is blocked synchronously waiting on the task through methods such as Wait and WaitAll also continue to run with an exception.</p>
<p>The TAP method returns a Canceled task if a cancellation token has requested cancellation before the TAP method that accepts that token is called.</p>
<p>The cancellation method accepts a cancellation token that indicates whether the method is actually cancelable.</p>
<h2><a href="#progress-reporting-optional)" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="progress-reporting-optional)"></a>Progress reporting (optional)</h2>
<p>Some asynchronous operations benefit from providing progress notifications; these are typically used to update a user interface with information about the progress of the asynchronous operation.</p>
<p>In TAP, progress is handled through an <code>IProgress&lt;T&gt;</code> interface, which is passed to the asynchronous method as a parameter that is usually named progress.  Providing the progress interface when the asynchronous method is called helps eliminate race conditions that result from incorrect usage (that is, when event handlers that are incorrectly registered after the operation starts may miss updates).  More importantly, the progress interface supports varying implementations of progress, as determined by the consuming code.  For example, the consuming code may only care about the latest progress update, or may want to buffer all updates, or may want to invoke an action for each update, or may want to control whether the invocation is marshalled to a particular thread. All these options may be achieved by using a different implementation of the interface, customized to the particular consumer's needs.  As with cancellation, TAP implementations should provide an <code>IProgress&lt;T&gt;</code> parameter only if the API supports progress notifications.</p>
<p>For example, if the <code>ReadAsync</code> method discussed earlier in this article is able to report intermediate progress in the form of the number of bytes read thus far, the progress callback could be an <code>IProgress&lt;T&gt;</code> interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count,
                      IProgress&lt;long&gt; progress)
</code></pre>
<p>If a <code>FindFilesAsync</code> method returns a list of all files that meet a particular search pattern, the progress callback could provide an estimate of the percentage of work completed and the current set of partial results. It could provide this information with either a tuple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task&lt;ReadOnlyCollection&lt;FileInfo&gt;&gt; FindFilesAsync(
            string pattern,
            IProgress&lt;Tuple&lt;double,
            ReadOnlyCollection&lt;List&lt;FileInfo&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; progress)
</code></pre>
<p>or with a data type that's specific to the API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task&lt;ReadOnlyCollection&lt;FileInfo&gt;&gt; FindFilesAsync(
    string pattern,
    IProgress&lt;FindFilesProgressInfo&gt; progress)
</code></pre>
<p>In the latter case, the special data type is usually suffixed with <code>ProgressInfo</code>.</p>
<p>If TAP implementations provide overloads that accept a progress parameter, they must allow the argument to be <code>null</code>, in which case no progress is reported. TAP implementations should report the progress to the <code>Progress&lt;T&gt;</code> object synchronously, which enables the asynchronous method to quickly provide progress. It also allows the consumer of the progress to determine how and where best to handle the information. For example, the progress instance could choose to marshal callbacks and raise events on a captured synchronization context.</p>
<h2><a href="#iprogresst>-implementations" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="iprogresst>-implementations"></a><code>IProgress&lt;T&gt;</code> implementations</h2>
<p>.NET provides the <code>Progress&lt;T&gt;</code> class, which implements <code>IProgress&lt;T&gt;</code>. The <code>Progress&lt;T&gt;</code> class is declared as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Progress&lt;T&gt; : IProgress&lt;T&gt;  
{  
    public Progress();  
    public Progress(Action&lt;T&gt; handler);  
    protected virtual void OnReport(T value);  
    public event EventHandler&lt;T&gt;? ProgressChanged;  
}
</code></pre>
<p>An instance of <code>Progress&lt;T&gt;</code> exposes a ProgressChanged event, which is raised every time the asynchronous operation reports a progress update. The <code>ProgressChanged</code> event is raised on the <code>SynchronizationContext</code> object that was captured when the <code>Progress&lt;T&gt;</code> instance was instantiated. If no synchronization context was available, a default context that targets the thread pool is used. Handlers may be registered with this event. A single handler may also be provided to the <code>Progress&lt;T&gt;</code> constructor for convenience, and behaves just like an event handler for the ProgressChanged event. Progress updates are raised asynchronously to avoid delaying the asynchronous operation while event handlers are executing. Another <code>IProgress&lt;T&gt;</code> implementation could choose to apply different semantics.</p>
<h2><a href="#choosing-the-overloads-to-provide" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="choosing-the-overloads-to-provide"></a>Choosing the overloads to provide</h2>
<p>If a TAP implementation uses both the optional <code>CancellationToken</code> and optional <code>IProgress&lt;T&gt;</code> parameters, it could potentially require up to four overloads:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task MethodNameAsync(…);  
public Task MethodNameAsync(…, CancellationToken cancellationToken);  
public Task MethodNameAsync(…, IProgress&lt;T&gt; progress);
public Task MethodNameAsync(…,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken, IProgress&lt;T&gt; progress);
</code></pre>
<p>However, many TAP implementations don't provide cancellation or progress capabilities, so they require a single method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task MethodNameAsync(…);
</code></pre>
<p>If a TAP implementation supports either cancellation or progress but not both, it may provide two overloads:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task MethodNameAsync(…);  
public Task MethodNameAsync(…, CancellationToken cancellationToken);  
  
// … or …  
  
public Task MethodNameAsync(…);  
public Task MethodNameAsync(…, IProgress&lt;T&gt; progress);
</code></pre>
<p>If a TAP implementation supports both cancellation and progress, it may expose all four overloads. However, it may provide only the following two:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public Task MethodNameAsync(…);  
public Task MethodNameAsync(…,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken, IProgress&lt;T&gt; progress);
</code></pre>
<p>To compensate for the two missing intermediate combinations, developers may pass None or a default CancellationToken for the <code>cancellationToken</code> parameter and <code>null</code> for the progress parameter.</p>
<p>If you expect every usage of the TAP method to support cancellation or progress, you may omit the overloads that don't accept the relevant parameter.</p>
<p>If you decide to expose multiple overloads to make cancellation or progress optional, the overloads that don't support cancellation or progress should behave as if they passed None for cancellation or <code>null</code> for progress to the overload that does support these.</p>
