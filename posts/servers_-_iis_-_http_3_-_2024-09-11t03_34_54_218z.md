## In this article
 - In-process

 - Out-of-Process. In Out-of-Process, IIS responds to the client using ```HTTP/3```, but the reverse proxy connection to the Kestrel server uses ```HTTP/1.1```.

 - Windows Server 2022 / Windows 11 or later

 - An ```https``` url binding is used.

 - The EnableHttp3 registry key is set.

## Alt-Svc

```C#
app.Use((context, next) =>
{
    context.Response.Headers.AltSvc = "h3=\":443\"";
    return next(context);
});
```
