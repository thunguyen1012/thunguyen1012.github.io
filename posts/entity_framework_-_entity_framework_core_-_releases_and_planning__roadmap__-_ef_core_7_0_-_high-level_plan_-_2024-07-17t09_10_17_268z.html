<h2><a href="#in-this-article" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="in-this-article"></a>In this article</h2>
<p>As described in the planning process, we have gathered input from stakeholders into a plan for Entity Framework Core 7.0 (EF Core 7.0.) For brevity, EF Core 7.0 is also referred to as just EF7.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Important
This plan is not a commitment; it will evolve as we continue to learn throughout the release. Some things not currently planned for EF7 may get pulled in. Some things currently planned for EF7 may get punted out.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#general-information" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="general-information"></a>General information</h2>
<p>EF Core 7.0 is the next release after EF Core 6.0 and is currently scheduled for release in November 2022 at the same time as .NET 7. There are no plans for an EF Core 6.1 release.</p>
<h3><a href="#supported-platforms" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="supported-platforms"></a>Supported platforms</h3>
<p>EF7 is the latest release of the .NET Development Framework.</p>
<p>EF7 will align with the .NET support policy and will therefore not be a long-term support (LTS) release.</p>
<h3><a href="#breaking-changes" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="breaking-changes"></a>Breaking changes</h3>
<p>EF7 will contain a small number of breaking changes as we continue to evolve both EF Core and the .NET platform. Our goal is to minimize breaking changes as much as possible.</p>
<h2><a href="#themes" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="themes"></a>Themes</h2>
<p>The large investments in EF7 will fall mainly under the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Highly requested features</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NET platforms and ecosystem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear path forward from EF6</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following themes have been updated with new features.</p>
<h2><a href="#theme-highly-requested-features" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="theme-highly-requested-features"></a>Theme: Highly requested features</h2>
<p>We are planning to release EF7 later this year.</p>
<h3><a href="#json-columns" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="json-columns"></a>JSON columns</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #4021: Map JSON values stored in database to EF properties</p>
<p>Value proposition: Save and query into JSON-based documents stored in relational database columns.</p>
<p>We are working on a new support feature for Npg and Pomelo.</p>
<h3><a href="#bulk-updates" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="bulk-updates"></a>Bulk updates</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #795: Bulk (i.e. set-based) CUD operations (without loading data into memory)</p>
<p>Value proposition: Efficient, predicate-based updates for many database rows without loading data into memory.</p>
<p>This article describes how to use change tracking followed by <code>SaveChanges</code> in EF Core.</p>
<p>tracked updates involve loading entities into memory and then executing those changes.</p>
<p>We want to make it easier for users to update and delete entities in the database.</p>
<h3><a href="#lifecycle-hooks" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="lifecycle-hooks"></a>Lifecycle hooks</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #626: Lifecycle hooks</p>
<p>Value proposition: Allow applications to react when interesting things happen in EF code.</p>
<p>The Entity Framework (EF) has a number of lifecycle hooks.</p>
<h3><a href="#table-per-concrete-type-tpc)-mapping" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="table-per-concrete-type-tpc)-mapping"></a>Table-per-concrete-type (TPC) mapping</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #3170: TPC inheritance mapping pattern</p>
<p>Value proposition: Map entities in a hierarchy to separate tables without taking the performance hit of TPT mapping.</p>
<p>EF Core supports inheritance mapping for .NET inheritance hierarchies. EF Core supports table-per-hierarchy () and table-per-type (TPT) mapping for .NET inheritance hierarchies.</p>
<p>The work for TPC mapping also covers more general entity splitting, and support for specifying different facets per table in TPT, TPC or entity splitting.</p>
<h3><a href="#map-cud-operations-to-stored-procedures" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="map-cud-operations-to-stored-procedures"></a>Map CUD operations to stored procedures</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #245: Map inserts, updates, and deletes (CUD operations) to stored procedures</p>
<p>Value proposition: Use stored procedures to manage data modifications.</p>
<p>EF Core already supports querying data from stored procedures. This feature will allow mapping the inserts, updates, and deletes generated by <code>SaveChanges</code> to stored procedures in the database.</p>
<h3><a href="#value-objects" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="value-objects"></a>Value objects</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #9906: Use C# structs or classes as value objects</p>
<p>Value proposition: Applications can use DDD-style value objects in EF models.</p>
<p>The team view on value objects has changed.</p>
<p>This work is initially scoped to allow value converters which map to multiple columns. We may pull in additional support based on feedback during the release.</p>
<h3><a href="#support-value-generation-when-using-value-converters" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="support-value-generation-when-using-value-converters"></a>Support value generation when using value converters</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #11597: Support more types of value generation with converters</p>
<p>Value proposition: DDD-style encapsulated key types can make full use of automatically generated key values.</p>
<p>EF Core 6.0 allowed more types of value generation to be used with keys mapped through value converters. We plan to generalize and expand this support in EF7.</p>
<h3><a href="#raw-sql-queries-for-unmapped-types" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="raw-sql-queries-for-unmapped-types"></a>Raw SQL queries for unmapped types</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #10753: Support raw SQL queries without defining an entity type for the result</p>
<p>Value proposition: Applications can execute more types of raw SQL query without dropping down to ADO.NET or using third-party libraries.</p>
<p>raw SQL queries can return types that are not contained in the EF model.</p>
<p>The work here will also cover raw SQL queries that return simple/scalar types, such as <code>Guid</code>, <code>DateTime</code>, <code>int</code>, and <code>string</code>.</p>
<h3><a href="#database-scaffolding-templates" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="database-scaffolding-templates"></a>Database scaffolding templates</h3>
<p>Tracked by Issue #4038: Code templates for scaffolding entity types and <code>DbContext</code> from an existing database</p>
<p>Value proposition: The code generated by <code>dotnet ef database scaffold</code> can be fully customized.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to adjust the code generated when scaffolding (reverse engineering) from an existing database.</p>
<h2><a href="#theme-.net-platforms-and-ecosystem" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="theme-.net-platforms-and-ecosystem"></a>Theme: .NET platforms and ecosystem</h2>

<p>Tracked by Issue #715 in dotnet/runtime: Implement distributed/promoted transactions in <code>System.Transactions</code></p>
<p>Value proposition: .NET Framework applications using distributed transactions can be ported to .NET 7.</p>
<p>.NET 7 will support distributed transactions in database scenarios where the ADO.NET provider also supports distributed transactions.</p>
