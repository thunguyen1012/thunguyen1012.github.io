## Advanced ```HTTP/2``` features

### Trailers

```csharp
if (httpContext.Response.SupportsTrailers())
{
    httpContext.Response.DeclareTrailer("trailername");	

    // Write body
    httpContext.Response.WriteAsync("Hello world");

    httpContext.Response.AppendTrailer("trailername", "TrailerValue");
}
```

 - ```SupportsTrailers``` ensures that trailers are supported for the response.

 - ```DeclareTrailer``` adds the given trailer name to the ```Trailer``` response header. Declaring a response's trailers is optional, but recommended. If ```DeclareTrailer``` is called, it must be before the response headers are sent.

 - ```AppendTrailer``` appends the trailer.

### ```Reset```

```csharp
var resetFeature = httpContext.Features.Get<IHttpResetFeature>();
resetFeature.Reset(errorCode: 2);
```
